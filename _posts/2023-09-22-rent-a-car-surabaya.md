<h2 class="post">Tips for Renting a Car in Surabaya:</h2>
<p class="post">Documentation: Ensure you have a valid driver's license from your home country. An international driving permit (IDP) is recommended, although some car rental agencies may accept your native license.</p>
<p class="post">Age Requirements: Check the minimum age requirements for renting a car in Surabaya, as they may vary between rental companies. Typically, the minimum age is 21 or 23 years old.</p>
<p class="post">Fuel: Familiarize yourself with the fuel type your rental car uses (usually gasoline or diesel) and fill up the tank before returning the vehicle to avoid additional charges.</p>
<p class="post">Navigation: Make sure your rental car comes equipped with GPS or use a reliable navigation app to help you get around Surabaya and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="post">Driving in Surabaya: Be prepared for heavy traffic in certain parts of Surabaya, especially during rush hours. Drive cautiously, obey traffic rules, and be aware of local driving customs.</p>
<p class="post">Parking: Look for secure parking options when visiting crowded areas in Surabaya. Many attractions and malls have designated parking facilities.</p>
<p class="post">Emergency Contacts: Save emergency numbers in your phone, such as local police (110), ambulance (118), and roadside assistance services provided by the rental company.</p>
<p class="post">Language: While English is spoken at many tourist sites, having a basic understanding of Bahasa Indonesia can be helpful, especially when communicating with locals.</p>
<p class="post">Local Cuisine: Don't miss the opportunity to savor Surabaya's diverse culinary offerings. Try dishes like rawon (beef black soup), rujak cingur (salad with cow snout), and lontong balap (a traditional dish with rice cake and bean sprouts).</p>
